#Movie synopsis

An evil mastermind is urging a villainous plan to take over the world, and he has kidnapped McCliché's girlfriend.

McCliché and his hacker friend Chester have been assigned the mission to find and kill the bad guy, and the whole United States world is counting on them to succeed and save the day.

#List of clichés

- One man army: You, as the protagonist of the movie, have to take care of everything.
- Infinite ammo: Have you ever seen a good guy reloading in an action movie?
- Bad guys always miss theirs shots: Enemies will always miss their first shot to the player.
- Badass protagonist: Noble tough guy that likes one liners and will oblierate an entire army all by himself.
- One liners: The protagonist says one liners in certain situations.
- Tough guys don't look at explosions: Explosions don't damage you.
- Kidnapped girlfriend: Quite self explanatory.
- Bad for no reason: The Bad Guy has no motivation for his evilness, he's just... a Bad Guy.
- Technologically advanced enemy base: The Bad Guy has a very technological base full of neons and sci-fi looking stuff.
- Self-destruction: The Bad Guy's base self explodes.
- Happy ending: Quite self explanatory.
- Red exploding barrels: Quite self explanatory.
- Take cover to heal: As in many games from the PS3 & Xbox360 era, you heal after not being hit for some time.
- Blood screen: You have been damaged? Your screen is red now.
- Invisible walls: Your character is almighty, but a box in the way will make an area totally inaccessible.
