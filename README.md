Glass Jungle is a FPS videogame where you play as McCliché, the protagonist of a ficticious 80's action movie called Glass Jungle.

- Become badass: Take control of McCliché and feel like a real action movie protagonist!
- Ready, set, ACTION: Play in 3 different movie scenes packed with action, explosions and thugs to shoot!
- Defeat the big baddie: Reach the final boss and test your skills against a truly bad motherf***er!

Glass Jungle has been developed by Morphine Games for the #GameOff2022 game jam, whose theme is "Cliché":

    A phrase or an idea that has been used so often that it no longer has much meaning and is not interesting.

# Movie synopsis

An evil mastermind is urging a villainous plan to take over the world, and he has kidnapped McCliché's girlfriend.

McCliché and his hacker friend Chester have been assigned the mission to find and kill the bad guy, and the whole ~~United States~~ world is counting on them to succeed and save the day.

# List of clichés

- **One man army:** You, as the protagonist of the movie, have to take care of everything.
- **Infinite ammo:** Have you ever seen a good guy reloading in an action movie?
- **Bad guys always miss theirs shots:** Enemies will always miss their first shot to the player.
- **Badass protagonist:** Noble tough guy that likes one liners and will oblierate an entire army all by himself.
- **One liners:** The protagonist says one liners in certain situations.
- **Tough guys don't look at explosions:** Explosions don't damage you.
- **Kidnapped girlfriend:** Quite self explanatory.
- **Bad for no reason:** The Bad Guy has no motivation for his evilness, he's just... a Bad Guy.
- **Technologically advanced enemy base:** The Bad Guy has a very technological base full of neons and sci-fi looking stuff.
- **Self-destruction:** The Bad Guy's base self explodes.
- **Happy ending:** Quite self explanatory.
- **Red exploding barrels:** Quite self explanatory.
- **Take cover to heal:** As in many games from the PS3 & Xbox360 era, you heal after not being hit for some time.
- **Blood screen:** You have been damaged? Your screen is red now.
- **Invisible walls:** Your character is almighty, but a box in the way will make an area totally inaccessible.
